ðŸ§¾ HR Analytics â€“ Employee Attrition Prediction
ðŸ”¹ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand why employees leave and predicting future attrition using machine learning.

ðŸ”¹ Abstract
Using employee data, we performed data analysis and built a model to identify key factors influencing attrition. The goal is to help companies reduce employee turnover.

ðŸ”¹ Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”¹ Project Steps
Data Cleaning â€“ Removed missing values, encoded categories.

EDA â€“ Found attrition is high in certain departments and low salary groups.

Model Building â€“ Used Logistic Regression to predict attrition.

Evaluation â€“ Model accuracy and confusion matrix were calculated.

SHAP Analysis â€“ Explained why predictions were made.

Dashboard â€“ Created in Power BI to visualize key trends.

ðŸ”¹ Suggestions to Reduce Attrition
Improve salaries for low-band employees

Promote more often where overdue
